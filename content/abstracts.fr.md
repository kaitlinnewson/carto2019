### <a name="work1"></a>Building "deep" maps of the Great War: Critical information and modern approaches for developing integrated, interactive map exhibits using historical resources
[Rebecca Bartlett](../speakers#Bartlett), Carleton University
[Gordon Beck](../speakers#Beck) & [Jason Brodeur](../speakers#Brodeur), McMaster University
[Trevor Ford](../speakers#Ford), Wilfrid Laurier University

Corresponding with Canada’s 150th anniversary, the ongoing centenary of the First World War provides Canadians with an occasion to rediscover stories from a conflict that helped shape the identity of a nation. Among the many modes for communicating these experiences and events, interactive digital maps--or “deep maps”--provide a unique and powerful means of presenting information and engaging audiences. By interacting with diverse types of digitized historical materials arranged in both time and space, the user is afforded a media-rich, multidimensional experience of a story.

To this end, the goal of this workshop is to enhance participants’ understanding of cartography and history of the Great War, and to develop their skills for using digital historical materials to create interactive and integrative map exhibits. Through a series of integrated information sessions and hands-on activities, participants will reinforce their learning by discovering and developing materials, and building their own interactive map exhibit using one (or multiple) platforms. In the process, the workshop content will address a number of common issues related to historical GIS development.

Instructional elements of this workshop will include:

* Cartography and the great war: historical context; understanding and using grid reference systems; finding cartographic resources.
* Finding and understanding materials from the Great War
* Tackling common issues in HGIS
* Creating geospatial information from historical materials
* Developing ‘deep maps’: An introduction to a variety of platforms for creating interactive map exhibits.

## Wednesday, 21-June
### <a name="keynote1"></a>Keynote Address: Indigenous Mapping in Canada
[Andrew Thompson](../speakers#Thompson), The Firelight Group

This session will introduce the concept of indigenous mapping in Canada and outline how First Nations are using GIS technologies to advance their interests within the context of environmental assessment. Mapping plays a critical role in communicating different perspectives of land use.

### <a name="pres01a"></a>Bringing Spatial Approaches into the Humanities
[Julie Jones](../speakers#Jones), Simon Fraser University

This presentation will discuss strategies for introducing GIS and spatial thinking to researchers in the Humanities, with a focus on literature students. It can be a leap for this population of learners to think of the content they study as "data" or as something that can be visualized spatially. Dealing with these and other barriers will be addressed as approaches that are non-intimidating, accessible, and that also meet non-spatial learning objectives are shared.
